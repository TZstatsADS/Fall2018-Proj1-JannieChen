### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Happy Moment Comparison Analysis
+ This project is conducted by Jannie Chen

+ Project summary: You’ll see someone always has a happy face and someone keeps upset. But why? Curious about why people feel happy, it’s interesting to investigate the happy moment of people who have different countries, genders, ages, marriages and so on. To learn more, a research about happy moment started and analysis follows.
